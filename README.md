In this project, emotion recognition using facial expression analysis and EEG is performed. The dataset used here is DEAP and FER-2013 dataset. Multimodal recognition is done to cover up for the flaws in each type of mode, hence it overshoot the accuracies reached by either EEG or facial expressions and overall performed better. This project can be used to detect depression, avoid suicides, in Artificial Intelligience. Here various Machine Learning and Deep Learning models are employed like Random Forest(in EEG) and Convolutional Neural Networks(in facial expressions). For image processing and face detection in real time, OpenCV is used.
